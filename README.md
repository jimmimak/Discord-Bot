# Discord-Bot
This is a simple discord bot programmed in C#. This bot is programmed to execute specific commands and thus give specific answers to specific things that the user will type. For example if the user types in "!Hi" the bot will respond "Hey what's up?".

I couldn't upload the whole file (including the packages etc) so I only uploaded the code with which I set up the discord bot and the one which includes the commands that the bot will be executing.
